# 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Git is a version control system (VCS) created for a single task: managing changes to your files.

# 	* [A Brief History of Revision Control](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [The birth of Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Installation](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Get Ready](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

# 2. [The basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- This module explores the fundamental Git workflow: creating a repository, staging and committing snapshots, configuring options, and viewing the state of a repository.

# 	* [Create the example Site](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Colorful Website</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #07F">A Colorful Website</h1>
  <p>This is a website about color!</p>    
  
  <h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing going on (yet)</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Initialize the Git Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
cd /Users/carlossantiagocruz/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorial
```

- then initialize

```console
git init
```

- output

```console
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/carlossantiagocruz/Documents/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git/
```

# 	* [View the repository status](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git status
```

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

- Git does not automatically track files because there are often project files that we don't want to keep under revision control.

# 	* [Stage a snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- tell git to start tracking index.html

```console
git add index.html
```

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   index.html

```

- A snapshot represents the state of your project at a given point in time.
- Git's term for creating a snapshot is called staging
- Staging give us the opportunity to group related changes into distinct snapshots.

# 	* [Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git commit
```

# 	* [View the repository History](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git log
```

- output

```console
commit 6a442fcc4ab51362713f09ed5eadc7af767db833
Author: c4arl0s <c.santiago.cruz@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 12:54:21 2020 -0500

    Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Configure Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

[read book if you want more information]

# 	* [Create New HTML files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- orange.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Orange Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #F90">The Orange Page</h1>
  <p>Orange is so great it has a
  <span style="color: #F90">fruit</span> named after it.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

- blue.html

```console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Blue Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #00F">The Blue Page</h1>
  <p>Blue is the color of the sky.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage the New Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git add orange.html blue.html
```

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   blue.html
	new file:   orange.html

```

# 	* [Commit The new Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git commit -m "add blue and orangle html file"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 13 47 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82699708-c1af2400-9c32-11ea-800a-1b578fcbcac5.png)

# 	* [Modify the HTML Pages](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- add this at the end of index.html

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
```

- add this at the end of orange.html

```html
<p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git status
```

- output

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

-

```console
$ git add index.html orange.html blue.html 
```

- status

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

```

- commit 

```console
$ git commit -m "Add navigation links"
[master 453c8a4] Add navigation links
 2 files changed, 10 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

- Note that the red circle, which represent the current commit, automatically moves forward every time we commit a new snapshot.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 16 55 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82712156-0d6ec700-9c4d-11ea-8dd1-8f705f6996ae.png)

# 	* [Explore the Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Condensing output to a single line is a great way to get a high-level overview of a repository
- Another useful configuration is to pass a filename to git log:

```console
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

- This display only  the blue.html history.
- Notice that the initial Create index page commit is missing, since blue.html did't exist in that snapshot.

# 	* [Quick Reference](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git init
```

```console
git status
```

```console
git add fileName
```

```console
git commit
```

```console
git log
```

```console
git config --global user.name "nameOfTheUser"
```


# 3. [Undoing Changes](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- In the last module, we learned how to record versions of a project into a Git repositoru.
- The whole point of maintaining these "safe" copies is peace of mind: should our project suddenly break, we will know that we have easy access to a functional version, and we will be able to pinpoint precisely where the problem was introduced.

- To this end, storing "safe" versions is not much help without the ability to restore them.- Our next task is to learn how to view the previous states of a project, revert back to them, and reset uncommitted changes.

# 	* [Display Commit Checksums](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Quick review

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- git only outputs the first seven characters of the checksum.
- These first few characters effectively serve as a unique ID for each commit.

# 	* [View an Old Version](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git checkout 1047951
```

- output

```console
Note: switching to '1047951'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

```
# 	* [Undo Committed Changes]()

- We are ready to restore our stable tag by removing the most recent commit.
- Make sure to change the 12e24f0 to the ID to the crazy experiment's commit before running the next command:

```console
git revert 12e24f0
```

- This will show you the vim editor with the default message "Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
- Save and close

```console
$ git revert 12e24f0
Removing crazy.html
[master 3553479] Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
 1 file changed, 14 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 crazy.html
```

- git log

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Notice that instead of deleting the "crazzy experiment" commit, Git figures out how to undo the changes it contains, the tacks on another commit with the resulting content.
- So, our fifth commit and our third commit represent the exact same snapshot, as shown below.
- Again, Git is designed to never lose history: the fourth snapshot is still accessible, just in case we want to continue developing it.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 21 15 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82719550-605a7580-9c71-11ea-9926-618e5053ab4c.png)

- When using git revert, remember to specify the commit that you want to undo-- not the stable commit that you want to return to.
- It helps to think of this command as saying "undo this commit" rather than "restore this version"

# 	* [Start a Smaller Experiment]()

- Let's try a smaller experiment this time.
- Create dummy.html and leave it as a blank file.
- Then, add a link in the "Navigation Section" of index.html so that it resembles the following.

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
	<a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="dummy.html">The Dummy Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

- In the next section, we are going to abandon this uncommitted experiment. But since the git revert command requires a commit ID to undo, we can't use the method discussed above.

# 	* [Undo Uncommitted Changes]()

- Before we start undoing things, let's take a look at the status of our repository

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

- We have a tracked file and an untracked file that need to be changed. First, we will take care of index.html

```console
git reset --hard
```

- output

```console
HEAD is now at 3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
```

- This changes all tracked files to match the most recent commit. Note that the --hard flag is what actually updates the file.
- Running git reset without any flags will simply unstage index.html, leaving its contents as is.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html
```

- In either case, git reset only operates on the working directory and the staging area, so our git log history remains unchanged.

* Next, let's remove the dummy.html file.
* Of course, we could manually delete it, but using Git to reset changes eliminates human errors when working with several files in large teams.
- Run the following commands,

```console
$ git clean -f
Removing dummy.html
```

- This will remove all untracked files. With dummy.html gone, git status should now tell us that we have a "clean" working directory, meaning our project matches the most recent commit.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- **Be careful** with **git reset** and **git clean**. Both operate on the working directory, not on the committed snapshots.
- Unlike **git revert**, they **permanently undo changes, so make sure you really want to trash what you are working on before you use them.

# 4. [Branches I]()

- Branches are the final component of Git version control.
- This gives us four core elements to work with throughout the rest of this tutorial:

	* The working directory
	* The staged Snapshot
	* Committed Snapshots
	* Development Branches

- In Git, a branch is an independent line of development.
- First, Branches present an error-proof method for incorporating changes from an experiment.
- Second, they let you store all of your experiments in a single directory, which makes it much easier to keep track of them and to share them with others.
- Branches also lend themselves to several standardized workflows for both individual and colavorative development, which will b explored in the latter half of the tutorial.

# 	* [View existing Branches]()

- Lets start our exploration by listing the existingg branches for our project

```console
$ git branch
* master
```

- This will display our one and only branch: * master.
- The master branch is Git's default branch, and the asterisk next to ir tell us that it is currently checked out.
- This means that the most recent snapshot in the master branch resides in the working directory.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 09 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731472-cde7bf80-9ccc-11ea-9029-32deb45c901f.png)

- Notice that since there is only one working directory for each project, only one branch can be checked out at a time.

# 	* [Checkout the Crazy Experiment]()

- The previous module left out some details about ho to checking out previous commits actually works.
- We are now ready to tackle this topic in depth.
- First, we need the checksums of our committed snapshots.

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Check out the crazy experiment from the last module, remembering to change 

```console
git checkout 12e24f0
```

- This command returns a message that says we are in a **detached HEAD state** and that the **HEAD** is git's internal way of indicating the snapshot that is currently checked out.

```console
HEAD detached at 12e24f0
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- This means the red circle in each of our history diagrams actually represets Git's HEAD.
- The followin figure shows the state of our repository before and after we checked out and old commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 25 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731820-f7094f80-9cce-11ea-99d3-31959c7ce556.png)

- As shown in the "before" diagram, the **HEAD** normally resides on the tip of a development branch, But when we checked out the previous commit, the **HEAD** moved to the middle of the branch.
- We can no longer say we are on the **master** branch since it contains more recent snapshots than the **HEAD**.
- This is reflected in the **git branch** output, which tells us that we are currently on (no branch)

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  master
```

# 	* [Create a New Branch]()

- We can not add new commits when we are not on a branch, so let's create one now.
- This will take our current working directory and fork it into a new branch.

```console
git branch crazy
```

- print all branches

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  crazy
  master
```

- Note that git branch is a versatile command that can be used to either list branches or create them. 
- However, the above command only creates the crazy branch -It does not check it out.

```console
git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

- We are now free to experiment in the working directory without disturbing anything in the **master** branch.
- The **crazy** branch is a completely isolated development environment that can be visualized as the following:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 47 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732309-08a02680-9cd2-11ea-9a98-de50000acc64.png)

- Right now, the crazy branch, **HEAD**, and working directory are the exact same as the fourth commit.
- But as soon as we add another snapshot, we will see a fork in our project history.

# 	* [Make a Rainbow]()

- We will continue developing our crazy experiment by changing **crazy.html** to the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Crazy Experiment</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>A Crazy Experiment</h1>
	<p>Look! A Rainbow!</p>

<ul>
    <li style="color: red">Red</li>
    <li style="color: orange">Orange</li>
    <li style="color: yellow">Yellow</li>
    <li style="color: green">Green</li>
    <li style="color: blue">Blue</li>
    <li style="color: indigo">Indigo</li>
    <li style="color: violet">Violet</li>
</ul>
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Rainbow]()

- Hopefully, you are relatively familiar with staging and committing snapshots by now:

```console
git add crazy.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   crazy.html
```

```console
git commit -m "add a rainbow to crazy.html"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 01 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732641-03dc7200-9cd4-11ea-8d05-6d3d19922e60.png)

- Also notice that the **HEAD** (designated by the red circle) automatically moved forward to the new commit, which is intutively what we would expect when developing a project.
- The above diagram represents the complete state of our repository, but **git log** only displays the history of the current branch:

```console
git log
commit e1bc77119319d8b38ff46dbddd968f669cc37a4c

Date:   Fri May 22 12:54:21 2020 -0500

    Create index page for the message
```

- Note that the history **before** the fork is considered part of the new branch (marked with asterisks above).
- That is to say, the crazy history spans all the way back to the first commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 08 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732774-f07dd680-9cd4-11ea-8454-50261fc15be0.png)

- The project as a whole now has a complex history, however, each individual branch still has a linear history (snapshots occur one after another).
- This means that we can interact with branches in the exact same way as we learned in the first two modules.

# 	* [Rename the Rainbow]()

- Let's add one more snapshot to the crazy branch.
- Rename **crazy.html to **rainbow.html, 

```console
mv crazy.html rainbow.html

- then use the following Git commands to update the repository

```console
git status
On branch crazy
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    crazy.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	rainbow.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```console
git rm crazy.html
rm 'crazy.html'
```

- the git rm command tells Git to stop tacking crazy.html (and delete it if necesarry), and git add starts tracking rainbow.html.

```console
git add rainbow.html
```

```console
git status
On branch crazy
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    crazy.html -> rainbow.html
```

- The renamed: crazy.html -> rainbow.html message in the final status output show us that Git is smart enough to figure out when we are renaming a file.

- Our snapshot is staged and ready to be commited:

```console
git commit -m "Rename craz.html to rainbow.html"
crazy 95a36a7] Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename crazy.html => rainbow.html (100%)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
95a36a7 (HEAD -> crazy) Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```
- After this addition, our complete repository history looks like the following

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 11 01 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82735083-cc29f600-9ce4-11ea-89b2-22cc74585e12.png)

- Remember that the crazy branch does not include any commits in master after the fork.
	
# 	* [Return to the Master Branch]()

- lets switch back to the master branch:

```console
git checkout master
git branch
```

```console
git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- After the checkout, crazy.html does not exist in the working directory, and the commits from the last few steps don't appear in the history. These two branches became completely independent development enviroments after they forked.
- You can think of them as separate project folders that you switch between with git checkout.
- They do, however, share their first four commits.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 11 37 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82735782-e0bcbd00-9ce9-11ea-9ccc-c6b53df0324c.png)

# 	* [Create a CSS Branch]()

- We are going to put our crazy experiment on the backburner for now and turn our attention to formatting the HTML pages with a cascading stylesheet (CSS).
- Again, if you are not comfortable with HTML and CSS, the content of the upcoming files is not nearly as important as the Git commands used to manage them.

- Let's create and check out a new branch called css.

```console
git branch css
```

- switche to css branch

```cosnsole
git checkout css
Switched to branch 'css'
```

- The new branch points to the currently checked out snapshot, which happens to coincide wih the **master branch**

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 8 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82755691-e1f9f280-9d9a-11ea-9b4c-d44f0d352cae.png)

# 	* [Add a CSS Stylesheet]()

- Next, create a file called **style.css** with the following content.
- This CSS is used to apply formatting to the HTML in our other files.

```css
body {
  padding: 20px;
  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #111;
}

p, ul {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

ul {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

- Commit the stylesheet in th usual fashion

```console
git add style.css
git status
git commit -m "Add CSS stylesheet"
```

# 	* [Link the Stylesheet]()

- We still need to tell the HTML pages to use the formatting in style.css.
- Add the following text on a separate line after the **<title>** element in index.html, blue.html and orange.html (remember that rainbow.html only exist in the crazy branch).
- You should be able to see the CSS formatting by opening index.html in a web browser.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- Commit the changes

```console
$ git add index.html blue.html orange.html 
```

```console
git status
On branch css
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   blue.html
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

```

```console
$ git commit -m "link HTML pages to stylesheet"
[css 1a27d0e] link HTML pages to stylesheet
 3 files changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
1a27d0e (HEAD -> css) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
3553479 (master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- This results in a repository history looks like:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 8 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82755691-e1f9f280-9d9a-11ea-9b4c-d44f0d352cae.png)

# 	* [Return to the Master Branch (again)]()

- The css branch let us create and test our formatting without threatening the stability of the **master branch**. But, noew we need to merge these changes into the main project. Before we attemp the merge, we need to return to the master branch.

```console
git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

- Verify that style.css does not exist and that HTML pages are not linked to it.
- Our repository history remains unchanged, but the working directory now matches the snapshot pointer to by the **master branch**.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 9 27 38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82756619-d6a9c580-9da0-11ea-9445-a23d899e9189.png)

- take a look at the **git log --oneline** output as well.

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- As expected, there is no mention of the CSS addition in the history of master, but we are about to change that.

# 	* [Merge the CSS Branch]()

- Use the git **merge** command to take the snapshots from the **css** branch and add them to the **master** branch.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 9 38 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82756851-508e7e80-9da2-11ea-8c28-66833b9b5a21.png)

- Instead of re-creating the commits in css and adding them to the history of master, Git reuses the existing snapshots and simply moves the tip of **master** to match the tip of **css**.
- This kind of merge is called a **fast-forward merge**, since Git is **"fast-forwarding"** through the new commits in the **css** branch.


- After the merge, both branches have the exact same history, which makes them redundan.
- Unless we wanted to keep developing on the css branch, we are free to get rid of it.

# 	* [Delete the CSS Branch]()

- We can safely delete a branch by passing the -d flag to git branch.

```console
git branch -d css
Deleted branch css (was 1a27d0e).
```

- Since **css** and **master** represent the same branch, our history looks the same, though the **css** branch has been removed.
- I have also put the master branch's commits in a straight line in the following visualization, making it easier to track during the upcomming modules.

```console
git branch
  crazy
* master
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 11 12 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82758981-8be37a00-9daf-11ea-93a4-35e65b332800.png)

- Deleting branches is a relatively **"safe"** operation in the sense that Git will warn you if you are deleting a unmerged branch.
- This is just another example of Git's commitment to never losing your work.

# 	* [Conclusion]()

Creating a new branch is really just a way to keep this high-level overview in mind during your every day development.

# 	* [Quick Reference]()

```console
git branch
git branch branchName
git checkout branchName
git merge branchName
git branch -d brachName
git rm fileName
```

# 5. [Branches II]()

Now that you have covered the mechanics behind Git Branches, we can discuss the practical impact that they have on the software development process.
Instead of introducing new commands, this module covers how the typical Git user applies this workfow to real projects, as well as some of the problems that arise in a branched enviroment.

To git, a branch is a branch, but it is often useful to assign special meaning to different branches. For example, we have been using **master** as the stable branch for our example project, and we have also used a temporary branch to add some CSS formatting.
Temporary branches like the latter are called **topic branches** becaue they exis to develop a certain topic branches later in this module.

Amid our exploration of Git branches, we will also discover that some merges cannot **"fast-forwarded"**
When the history of two branches diverges, a dedicated commit is required to combine the branches. This situation may also give rise to a merge conflict, which must be manually resolved before anything can be committed to the repository.


# 	* [Continue the Crazy Experiment]()

Let`s start by checking out the crazy branch.

```console
git branch
  crazy
* master
```

```console
$ git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
95a36a7 (HEAD -> crazy) Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

The crazy branch is a **longer-running** type of topic branch called a **feature branch**.
This is fitting, as it was created with the intention of developing a **specific feature**. It is also a term tht makes Git's contribution to the development workflow readly apparaent: **branches enable you to focus on developing one clearly defined feature at a time**

This brings us to my **rule-thumb for using git branches**:

1. Create a new branch for each mayor addition to your project.
2. Don't create a branch if you cannot give it a specific name.

Following these simple guidelines will have a dramatic impact on your programming efficiency.


# 	* [Merge the CSS Updates]()

Note that CSS formatting we merged into **master*Ç* is nowhere to be found.
This presents a bit of a problem if we want to experiment to reflect these updates.
Conveniently, Git let us merge changes into **any branch** (not just the master branch).
So, we can pull the updates in with the familiar **git merge** command.
Remember that merging only affects the checked-out branch.

```console
git merge maste
```

- editing

```vim
Merge branch 'master' into crazy
""
""
""
```

```console
$ git merge master
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 blue.html   |  1 +
 index.html  |  1 +
 orange.html |  1 +
 style.css   | 14 ++++++++++++++
 4 files changed, 17 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 style.css
```

As of Git 1.7.1.0, this will open your editor and prompt you for a message explaining why the commit was necessary.
You can use the default **Merge** branch **master** into crazy. When you save and close the file, you will notice an extra commit in your project history. Recall that our first merge didn't add any new commits; it is just **"fast-forwarded" the tip of the master branch. This was not the case for our new merge, which is shown below.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 11 50 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82759729-c7cd0e00-9db4-11ea-9b4b-8e97fc80512e.png)

Take a moment to examine why the current merge could not be **fast-forward one**. 
How Could Git have walked the crazy pointer over the tip of the master branch ?
It is not possible without backtracking, which kind of defeats the idea of **"fast-forwarding"**
We are left with a new way to combine brancges: **the 3-way merge**

A 3-way merge occurs when you try to merge two branches whose history has diverged. It creates an extra merge commit to function as a link between the two branches.
As a result, it has two parent commits. The above figure visualizes this with two arros originating from the tip of crazy. It is like saying **"this commit comes from both the crazy branch and from master"**. After the merge, the crazy branch has access to both its history an the master history.

The name comes from the internal method used to create the merge commit. Git looks at **three** commits (numbered in the above figure) to generate the final state of the merge.

This kind of branch interaction is a big part of what makes Git such a powerful development tool. We can not only create independent lines of development, but we can alsosharee information between them by tying together their stories with a 3-way merge.

# 	* [Style the Rainbow Page]()

Now that we have access to the CSS updates from master, we can continue developing our crazy experiment.
Link the CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html by adding the following HTML on the line after **title** element

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- Stage and commit the update, then check that it is reflected in the history

```console
git status
On branch crazy
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   rainbow.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```console
$ git commit -a -m "add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html"
[crazy 6a43f42] add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```console
git log --oneline
6a43f42 (HEAD -> crazy) add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e (master) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

Notice that we skipped the staging step this time aroun.
Instead of using **git add**, we passed the -a flag to git commit.
This convenient parameter tells Git to automatically include all tracked files in the staged snapshot.
Combined with the -m flag, we can stage and commit snapshots with a single command.
However, be careful not to include unintended files when using the -a flag.

# 	* [Link to the Rainbow Page]()

We still need to add  navigation link to the home page.
Change the "Navigation sectio of index.html to the following.

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
    <a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="rainbow.html">The Rainbow Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

As usual, stage and commit the snapshots.

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Link index.html to rainbow.html"
[crazy 4310454] Link index.html to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
4310454 (HEAD -> crazy) Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e (master) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Fork an Alternative Rainbow]()

Next, we are going to brainstorm an alternative to the current rainbow.html page.
This is a perfect time to create another topic branch:

```console
git branch crazy-alt
```

```console
$ git checkout crazy-alt
Switched to branch 'crazy-alt'
```

Remember, we can do whatever we want here without worrying about either crazy o master.
When **git branch** creates a branch, it uses the current **HEAD** as the starting point for the new branch.
This meeans that we begin with the same files as crazy (if we called **git branch** from **master**, we would have to re-create rainbow.html).
After creating th new branch, our repository's history looks like:


![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 8 26 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82816850-8181b880-9e61-11ea-8f1e-0019d14a9538.png)

# 	* [Change the Rainbow]()

Change the colorful list in rainbow.html from:

```html
  <li style="color: red">Red</li>
  <li style="color: orange">Orange</li>
  <li style="color: yellow">Yellow</li>
  <li style="color: green">Green</li>
  <li style="color: blue">Blue</li>
  <li style="color: indigo">Indigo</li>
  <li style="color: violet">Violet</li>”
```

to the following:

```html
<div style="background-color: red"></div>
<div style="background-color: orange"></div>
<div style="background-color: yellow"></div>
<div style="background-color: green"></div>
<div style="background-color: blue"></div>
<div style="background-color: indigo"></div>
<div style="background-color: violet"></div>
```

Then, add some CSS formatting to **head** on the line after the **meta** element

```html
	<style>
  div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 50px;
		 }
	 </style>
```

If you open rainbow.html in a browser, you should now see colorful blocks in place of the colorful text. Don't forget to commit the changes:

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Make a REAL rainbow"
[crazy-alt d247771] Make a REAL rainbow
 1 file changed, 13 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
```

The resulting project history is show below, with the first four commits ommitted for the sake of presentation.

# 	* [Emergency Update]()

Our boss called in with some breaking news ! He needs us to update the site immediately, but what do we do with our rainbow.html developments? Well, the beauty of Git branches is that we can just leave them where they are and add the breaking news to master.

We will use what is called a **hotfix branch** to create and test the news updates. In contrast to our relatively long-running feature branch (crazy), hotfix branches are used to quickly patch a production release.

For example: you would use a hotfix branch to fix a time-sensitive bug in a public software project. This distinction is useful for demostrating when it is appropiate to create a new branch, but it is purely conceptual **- a branch is a branch according to Git**

```console
git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
git branch news-hotfix
```

```console
git checkout news-hotfix
Switched to branch 'news-hotfix'
```

Change the "News" list in **index.html** to match the following.

```html
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="news-1.html">Blue Is The New Hue</a></li>
  </ul>
```

And, create a new HTML page called **news-1.html** with the following content.

```console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Blue Is The New Hue</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #079">Blue Is The New Hue</h1>
  <p>European designers have just announced that
  <span style="color: #079">Blue</span> will be this year's
  hot color.</p>
    
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

We can't use **git commit -a** to automatically stage **news-1.html** because it is an **untracked file** (as shown in **git status**).
So, let's use an explicit **git add**:

```console
$ git add index.html news-1.html 
```

```console
git status
On branch news-hotfix
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	new file:   news-1.html

```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add 1st news item"
[news-hotfix 049c9d9] Add 1st news item
 2 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 news-1.html
```

Text these additions in a browser to make sure that the links work, it is typo free, etc. Ifeverything looks good, we can "publish" the changes by merging them into the stable master branch. Isolating this in a separate branch is not really necessary for our trivial example, but in the real world, this would give you the opportunity to run build tests without touching your stable project.

# 	* [Publish the News Hotfix]()

Remember that to merge into the **master** branch, we first need to check it out.

```console
git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git merge news-hotfix
Updating 1a27d0e..049c9d9
Fast-forward
 index.html  |  2 +-
 news-1.html | 16 ++++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 news-1.html
```

Since **master** now contains the news update, we can delete the **hotfix** branch:

```console
$ git branch -d news-hotfix
Deleted branch news-hotfix (was 049c9d9).
```

```console
$ git branch
  crazy
  crazy-alt
* master
```

The following diagram reflects our repository's history before and after the merge. Can you figure out why was this a fast-forward merge instead of a 3-way merge?

![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 9 40 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82822643-bb57bc80-9e6b-11ea-9d72-eb5c7f1d250c.png)

Also notice that we have another fork in our history (the commit before **master** branches in two directions), which means we should expect to see another merge commit in the near future.

# 	* [Complete the Crazy Experiment]()

Ok, lets finish up our crazy experiment with one more commit.

```console
git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

Note that the news article is nowhere to be found, as should be expected (this branch is completely isolated development environment).

We will finish up our crazy experiment by adding a news item for it on the home page. Change the news list in **index.html** to the following:

```html
<h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="rainbow.html">Our New Rainbow</a></li>
</ul>
```

Astute readers have probably observed that this directly conflicts with what we changed in the news-hotfix branch.
**We should not manually add in the other news item** because it has no relationship with the current branch. In addition, there would be no way to make sure the links works because news-1.html does not exist in this branch. This may seem trivial, but imagine the errors that could be introduced had news-hotfix made dozens of differente changes.

We will simply stage and commit the snapshot as if there were no conflicts:

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Add news item for rainbow"
[crazy ebb4171] Add news item for rainbow
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Look at those experimental commits (marked with asterisks below)!

```console
$ git log --oneline
* ebb4171 (HEAD -> crazy) Add news item for rainbow
* 4310454 Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
* 95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
* e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
* 12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
