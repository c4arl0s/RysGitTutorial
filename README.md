# 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Git is a version control system (VCS) created for a single task: managing changes to your files.

# 	* [A Brief History of Revision Control](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [The birth of Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Installation](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Get Ready](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

# 2. [The basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- This module explores the fundamental Git workflow: creating a repository, staging and committing snapshots, configuring options, and viewing the state of a repository.

# 	* [Create the example Site](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Colorful Website</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #07F">A Colorful Website</h1>
  <p>This is a website about color!</p>    
  
  <h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing going on (yet)</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Initialize the Git Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
cd /Users/carlossantiagocruz/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorial
```

- then initialize

```console
git init
```

- output

```console
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/carlossantiagocruz/Documents/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git/
```

# 	* [View the repository status](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git status
```

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

- Git does not automatically track files because there are often project files that we don't want to keep under revision control.

# 	* [Stage a snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- tell git to start tracking index.html

```console
git add index.html
```

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   index.html

```

- A snapshot represents the state of your project at a given point in time.
- Git's term for creating a snapshot is called staging
- Staging give us the opportunity to group related changes into distinct snapshots.

# 	* [Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git commit
```

# 	* [View the repository History](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git log
```

- output

```console
commit 6a442fcc4ab51362713f09ed5eadc7af767db833
Author: c4arl0s <c.santiago.cruz@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 12:54:21 2020 -0500

    Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Configure Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

[read book if you want more information]

# 	* [Create New HTML files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- orange.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Orange Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #F90">The Orange Page</h1>
  <p>Orange is so great it has a
  <span style="color: #F90">fruit</span> named after it.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

- blue.html

```console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Blue Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #00F">The Blue Page</h1>
  <p>Blue is the color of the sky.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage the New Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git add orange.html blue.html
```

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   blue.html
	new file:   orange.html

```

# 	* [Commit The new Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git commit -m "add blue and orangle html file"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 13 47 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82699708-c1af2400-9c32-11ea-800a-1b578fcbcac5.png)

# 	* [Modify the HTML Pages](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- add this at the end of index.html

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
```

- add this at the end of orange.html

```html
<p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git status
```

- output

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

-

```console
$ git add index.html orange.html blue.html 
```

- status

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

```

- commit 

```console
$ git commit -m "Add navigation links"
[master 453c8a4] Add navigation links
 2 files changed, 10 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

- Note that the red circle, which represent the current commit, automatically moves forward every time we commit a new snapshot.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 16 55 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82712156-0d6ec700-9c4d-11ea-8dd1-8f705f6996ae.png)

# 	* [Explore the Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Condensing output to a single line is a great way to get a high-level overview of a repository
- Another useful configuration is to pass a filename to git log:

```console
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

- This display only  the blue.html history.
- Notice that the initial Create index page commit is missing, since blue.html did't exist in that snapshot.


# 	* [Conclusion](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 17 01 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82712586-f086c380-9c4d-11ea-9896-d302b0345e8a.png)

# 	* [Quick Reference](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git init
```

```console
git status
```

```console
git add fileName
```

```console
git commit
```

```console
git log
```

```console
git config --global user.name "nameOfTheUser"
```


# 3. [Undoing Changes](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- In the last module, we learned how to record versions of a project into a Git repositoru.
- The whole point of maintaining these "safe" copies is peace of mind: should our project suddenly break, we will know that we have easy access to a functional version, and we will be able to pinpoint precisely where the problem was introduced.

- To this end, storing "safe" versions is not much help without the ability to restore them.- Our next task is to learn how to view the previous states of a project, revert back to them, and reset uncommitted changes.

# 	* [Display Commit Checksums](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Quick review

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- git only outputs the first seven characters of the checksum.
- These first few characters effectively serve as a unique ID for each commit.

# 	* [View an Old Version](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
git checkout 1047951
```

- output

```console
Note: switching to '1047951'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

# 	* [Try a Crazy Experiment]()

- create crazy.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Crazy Experiment</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>A Crazy Experiment</h1>
  <p>We're trying out a <span style="color: #F0F">crazy</span>

</html>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Snapshot]()

    Create index page for the message

```
# 	* [View the Stable Commit]()

```console
git checkout v1.0
```

- output

```console
HEAD is now at 453c8a4 Add navigation links
```

- go back to master

```console
git checkout master
```

- output

```console
Previous HEAD position was 453c8a4 Add navigation links
Switched to branch 'master'
```
# 	* [Undo Committed Changes]()

- We are ready to restore our stable tag by removing the most recent commit.
- Make sure to change the 12e24f0 to the ID to the crazy experiment's commit before running the next command:

```console
git revert 12e24f0
```

- This will show you the vim editor with the default message "Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
- Save and close

```console
$ git revert 12e24f0
Removing crazy.html
[master 3553479] Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
 1 file changed, 14 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 crazy.html
```

- git log

```console
git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Notice that instead of deleting the "crazzy experiment" commit, Git figures out how to undo the changes it contains, the tacks on another commit with the resulting content.
- So, our fifth commit and our third commit represent the exact same snapshot, as shown below.
- Again, Git is designed to never lose history: the fourth snapshot is still accessible, just in case we want to continue developing it.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 21 15 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82719550-605a7580-9c71-11ea-9926-618e5053ab4c.png)

- When using git revert, remember to specify the commit that you want to undo-- not the stable commit that you want to return to.
- It helps to think of this command as saying "undo this commit" rather than "restore this version"

# 	* [Start a Smaller Experiment]()

- Let's try a smaller experiment this time.
- Create dummy.html and leave it as a blank file.
- Then, add a link in the "Navigation Section" of index.html so that it resembles the following.

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
	<a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="dummy.html">The Dummy Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

- In the next section, we are going to abandon this uncommitted experiment. But since the git revert command requires a commit ID to undo, we can't use the method discussed above.

# 	* [Undo Uncommitted Changes]()

- Before we start undoing things, let's take a look at the status of our repository

```console
git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

- We have a tracked file and an untracked file that need to be changed. First, we will take care of index.html

```console
git reset --hard
```

- output

```console
HEAD is now at 3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
```

- This changes all tracked files to match the most recent commit. Note that the --hard flag is what actually updates the file.
- Running git reset without any flags will simply unstage index.html, leaving its contents as is.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html
```

- In either case, git reset only operates on the working directory and the staging area, so our git log history remains unchanged.

* Next, let's remove the dummy.html file.
* Of course, we could manually delete it, but using Git to reset changes eliminates human errors when working with several files in large teams.
- Run the following commands,

```console
$ git clean -f
Removing dummy.html
```

- This will remove all untracked files. With dummy.html gone, git status should now tell us that we have a "clean" working directory, meaning our project matches the most recent commit.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- **Be careful** with **git reset** and **git clean**. Both operate on the working directory, not on the committed snapshots.
- Unlike **git revert**, they **permanently undo changes, so make sure you really want to trash what you are working on before you use them.

# 4. [Branches I]()

- Branches are the final component of Git version control.
- This gives us four core elements to work with throughout the rest of this tutorial:

	* The working directory
	* The staged Snapshot
	* Committed Snapshots
	* Development Branches

- In Git, a branch is an independent line of development.
- First, Branches present an error-proof method for incorporating changes from an experiment.
- Second, they let you store all of your experiments in a single directory, which makes it much easier to keep track of them and to share them with others.
- Branches also lend themselves to several standardized workflows for both individual and colavorative development, which will b explored in the latter half of the tutorial.

# 	* [View existing Branches]()

- Lets start our exploration by listing the existingg branches for our project

```console
$ git branch
* master
```

- This will display our one and only branch: * master.
- The master branch is Git's default branch, and the asterisk next to ir tell us that it is currently checked out.
- This means that the most recent snapshot in the master branch resides in the working directory.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 09 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731472-cde7bf80-9ccc-11ea-9029-32deb45c901f.png)

- Notice that since there is only one working directory for each project, only one branch can be checked out at a time.

# 	* [Checkout the Crazy Experiment]()

- The previous module left out some details about ho to checking out previous commits actually works.
- We are now ready to tackle this topic in depth.
- First, we need the checksums of our committed snapshots.

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Check out the crazy experiment from the last module, remembering to change 

```console
git checkout 12e24f0
```

- This command returns a message that says we are in a **detached HEAD state** and that the **HEAD** is git's internal way of indicating the snapshot that is currently checked out.

```console
HEAD detached at 12e24f0
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- This means the red circle in each of our history diagrams actually represets Git's HEAD.
- The followin figure shows the state of our repository before and after we checked out and old commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 25 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731820-f7094f80-9cce-11ea-99d3-31959c7ce556.png)

- As shown in the "before" diagram, the **HEAD** normally resides on the tip of a development branch, But when we checked out the previous commit, the **HEAD** moved to the middle of the branch.
- We can no longer say we are on the **master** branch since it contains more recent snapshots than the **HEAD**.
- This is reflected in the **git branch** output, which tells us that we are currently on (no branch)

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  master
```

# 	* [Create a New Branch]()

- We can not add new commits when we are not on a branch, so let's create one now.
- This will take our current working directory and fork it into a new branch.

```console
git branch crazy
```

- print all branches

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  crazy
  master
```

- Note that git branch is a versatile command that can be used to either list branches or create them. 
- However, the above command only creates the crazy branch -It does not check it out.

```console
git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

- We are now free to experiment in the working directory without disturbing anything in the **master** branch.
- The **crazy** branch is a completely isolated development environment that can be visualized as the following:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 47 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732309-08a02680-9cd2-11ea-9a98-de50000acc64.png)

- Right now, the crazy branch, **HEAD**, and working directory are the exact same as the fourth commit.
- But as soon as we add another snapshot, we will see a fork in our project history.

# 	* [Make a Rainbow]()

- We will continue developing our crazy experiment by changing **crazy.html** to the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Crazy Experiment</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>A Crazy Experiment</h1>
	<p>Look! A Rainbow!</p>

<ul>
    <li style="color: red">Red</li>
    <li style="color: orange">Orange</li>
    <li style="color: yellow">Yellow</li>
    <li style="color: green">Green</li>
    <li style="color: blue">Blue</li>
    <li style="color: indigo">Indigo</li>
    <li style="color: violet">Violet</li>
</ul>
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Rainbow]()

- Hopefully, you are relatively familiar with staging and committing snapshots by now:

```console
git add crazy.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   crazy.html
```

```console
git commit -m "add a rainbow to crazy.html"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 01 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732641-03dc7200-9cd4-11ea-8d05-6d3d19922e60.png)

- Also notice that the **HEAD** (designated by the red circle) automatically moved forward to the new commit, which is intutively what we would expect when developing a project.
- The above diagram represents the complete state of our repository, but **git log** only displays the history of the current branch:

```console

    Create index page for the message
```

- Note that the history **before** the fork is considered part of the new branch (marked with asterisks above).
- That is to say, the crazy history spans all the way back to the first commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 08 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732774-f07dd680-9cd4-11ea-8454-50261fc15be0.png)

- The project as a whole now has a complex history, however, each individual branch still has a linear history (snapshots occur one after another).
- This means that we can interact with branches in the exact same way as we learned in the first two modules.
