# 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Git is a version control system (VCS) created for a single task: managing changes to your files.

# 	* [A Brief History of Revision Control](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [The birth of Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Installation](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)
# 	* [Get Ready](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

# 2. [The basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- This module explores the fundamental Git workflow: creating a repository, staging and committing snapshots, configuring options, and viewing the state of a repository.

# 	* [Create the example Site](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Colorful Website</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #07F">A Colorful Website</h1>
  <p>This is a website about color!</p>    
  
  <h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing going on (yet)</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Initialize the Git Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
cd /Users/carlossantiagocruz/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorial
```

- then initialize

```console
$ git init
```

- output

```console
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/carlossantiagocruz/Documents/SWIFT-PROGRAMMING/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git/
```

# 	* [View the repository status](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git status
```

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

- Git does not automatically track files because there are often project files that we don't want to keep under revision control.

# 	* [Stage a snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- tell git to start tracking index.html

```console
$ git add index.html
```

```console
$ git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   index.html

```

- A snapshot represents the state of your project at a given point in time.
- Git's term for creating a snapshot is called staging
- Staging give us the opportunity to group related changes into distinct snapshots.

# 	* [Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git commit
```

# 	* [View the repository History](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git log
```

- output

```console
commit 6a442fcc4ab51362713f09ed5eadc7af767db833
Author: c4arl0s <c.santiago.cruz@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 12:54:21 2020 -0500

    Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Configure Git](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git config --global user.name "your name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

[read book if you want more information]

# 	* [Create New HTML files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- orange.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Orange Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #F90">The Orange Page</h1>
  <p>Orange is so great it has a
  <span style="color: #F90">fruit</span> named after it.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

- blue.html

```console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Blue Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #00F">The Blue Page</h1>
  <p>Blue is the color of the sky.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage the New Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git add orange.html blue.html
```

```console
$ git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   blue.html
	new file:   orange.html

```

# 	* [Commit The new Files](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git commit -m "add blue and orangle html file"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 13 47 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82699708-c1af2400-9c32-11ea-800a-1b578fcbcac5.png)

# 	* [Modify the HTML Pages](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- add this at the end of index.html

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
```

- add this at the end of orange.html

```html
<p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Snapshot](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git status
```

- output

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

-

```console
$ git add index.html orange.html blue.html 
```

- status

```console
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

```

- commit 

```console
$ git commit -m "Add navigation links"
[master 453c8a4] Add navigation links
 2 files changed, 10 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

- Note that the red circle, which represent the current commit, automatically moves forward every time we commit a new snapshot.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 16 55 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82712156-0d6ec700-9c4d-11ea-8dd1-8f705f6996ae.png)

# 	* [Explore the Repository](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Condensing output to a single line is a great way to get a high-level overview of a repository
- Another useful configuration is to pass a filename to git log:

```console
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

- This display only  the blue.html history.
- Notice that the initial Create index page commit is missing, since blue.html did't exist in that snapshot.


# 	* [Conclusion](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 17 01 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82712586-f086c380-9c4d-11ea-9896-d302b0345e8a.png)

# 	* [Quick Reference](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git init
```

```console
$ git status
```

```console
$ git add fileName
```

```console
$ git commit
```

```console
$ git log
```

```console
$ git config --global user.name "nameOfTheUser"
```


# 3. [Undoing Changes](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- In the last module, we learned how to record versions of a project into a Git repositoru.
- The whole point of maintaining these "safe" copies is peace of mind: should our project suddenly break, we will know that we have easy access to a functional version, and we will be able to pinpoint precisely where the problem was introduced.

- To this end, storing "safe" versions is not much help without the ability to restore them.- Our next task is to learn how to view the previous states of a project, revert back to them, and reset uncommitted changes.

# 	* [Display Commit Checksums](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

- Quick review

```console
$ git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- git only outputs the first seven characters of the checksum.
- These first few characters effectively serve as a unique ID for each commit.

# 	* [View an Old Version](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

```console
$ git checkout 1047951
```

- output

```console
Note: switching to '1047951'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
```

```
# 	* [View the Stable Commit]()

```console
$ git checkout v1.0
```

- output

```console
HEAD is now at 453c8a4 Add navigation links
```

- go back to master

```console
$ git checkout master
```

- output

```console
Previous HEAD position was 453c8a4 Add navigation links
Switched to branch 'master'
```
# 	* [Undo Committed Changes]()

- We are ready to restore our stable tag by removing the most recent commit.
- Make sure to change the 12e24f0 to the ID to the crazy experiment's commit before running the next command:

```console
$ git revert 12e24f0
```

- This will show you the vim editor with the default message "Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
- Save and close

```console
$ git revert 12e24f0
Removing crazy.html
[master 3553479] Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
 1 file changed, 14 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 crazy.html
```

- git log

```console
$ git log --oneline
```

- output

```console
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Notice that instead of deleting the "crazzy experiment" commit, Git figures out how to undo the changes it contains, the tacks on another commit with the resulting content.
- So, our fifth commit and our third commit represent the exact same snapshot, as shown below.
- Again, Git is designed to never lose history: the fourth snapshot is still accessible, just in case we want to continue developing it.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 21 15 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82719550-605a7580-9c71-11ea-9926-618e5053ab4c.png)

- When using git revert, remember to specify the commit that you want to undo-- not the stable commit that you want to return to.
- It helps to think of this command as saying "undo this commit" rather than "restore this version"

# 	* [Start a Smaller Experiment]()

- Let's try a smaller experiment this time.
- Create dummy.html and leave it as a blank file.
- Then, add a link in the "Navigation Section" of index.html so that it resembles the following.

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
	<a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="dummy.html">The Dummy Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

- In the next section, we are going to abandon this uncommitted experiment. But since the git revert command requires a commit ID to undo, we can't use the method discussed above.

# 	* [Undo Uncommitted Changes]()

- Before we start undoing things, let's take a look at the status of our repository

```console
$ git status
```

- output

```console
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

- We have a tracked file and an untracked file that need to be changed. First, we will take care of index.html

```console
$ git reset --hard
```

- output

```console
HEAD is now at 3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
```

- This changes all tracked files to match the most recent commit. Note that the --hard flag is what actually updates the file.
- Running git reset without any flags will simply unstage index.html, leaving its contents as is.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	dummy.html
```

- In either case, git reset only operates on the working directory and the staging area, so our git log history remains unchanged.

* Next, let's remove the dummy.html file.
* Of course, we could manually delete it, but using Git to reset changes eliminates human errors when working with several files in large teams.
- Run the following commands,

```console
$ git clean -f
Removing dummy.html
```

- This will remove all untracked files. With dummy.html gone, git status should now tell us that we have a "clean" working directory, meaning our project matches the most recent commit.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- **Be careful** with **git reset** and **git clean**. Both operate on the working directory, not on the committed snapshots.
- Unlike **git revert**, they **permanently undo changes, so make sure you really want to trash what you are working on before you use them.

	
# 	* [Conclusion]()

# 4. [Branches I]()

- Branches are the final component of Git version control.
- This gives us four core elements to work with throughout the rest of this tutorial:

	* The working directory
	* The staged Snapshot
	* Committed Snapshots
	* Development Branches

- In Git, a branch is an independent line of development.
- First, Branches present an error-proof method for incorporating changes from an experiment.
- Second, they let you store all of your experiments in a single directory, which makes it much easier to keep track of them and to share them with others.
- Branches also lend themselves to several standardized workflows for both individual and colavorative development, which will b explored in the latter half of the tutorial.

# 	* [View existing Branches]()

- Lets start our exploration by listing the existingg branches for our project

```console
$ git branch
* master
```

- This will display our one and only branch: * master.
- The master branch is Git's default branch, and the asterisk next to ir tell us that it is currently checked out.
- This means that the most recent snapshot in the master branch resides in the working directory.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 09 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731472-cde7bf80-9ccc-11ea-9029-32deb45c901f.png)

- Notice that since there is only one working directory for each project, only one branch can be checked out at a time.

# 	* [Checkout the Crazy Experiment]()

- The previous module left out some details about ho to checking out previous commits actually works.
- We are now ready to tackle this topic in depth.
- First, we need the checksums of our committed snapshots.

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- Check out the crazy experiment from the last module, remembering to change 

```console
$ git checkout 12e24f0
```

- This command returns a message that says we are in a **detached HEAD state** and that the **HEAD** is git's internal way of indicating the snapshot that is currently checked out.

```console
HEAD detached at 12e24f0
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- This means the red circle in each of our history diagrams actually represets Git's HEAD.
- The followin figure shows the state of our repository before and after we checked out and old commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 25 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82731820-f7094f80-9cce-11ea-99d3-31959c7ce556.png)

- As shown in the "before" diagram, the **HEAD** normally resides on the tip of a development branch, But when we checked out the previous commit, the **HEAD** moved to the middle of the branch.
- We can no longer say we are on the **master** branch since it contains more recent snapshots than the **HEAD**.
- This is reflected in the **git branch** output, which tells us that we are currently on (no branch)

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  master
```

# 	* [Create a New Branch]()

- We can not add new commits when we are not on a branch, so let's create one now.
- This will take our current working directory and fork it into a new branch.

```console
$ git branch crazy
```

- print all branches

```console
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 12e24f0)
  crazy
  master
```

- Note that git branch is a versatile command that can be used to either list branches or create them. 
- However, the above command only creates the crazy branch -It does not check it out.

```console
$ git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

- We are now free to experiment in the working directory without disturbing anything in the **master** branch.
- The **crazy** branch is a completely isolated development environment that can be visualized as the following:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 8 47 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732309-08a02680-9cd2-11ea-9a98-de50000acc64.png)

- Right now, the crazy branch, **HEAD**, and working directory are the exact same as the fourth commit.
- But as soon as we add another snapshot, we will see a fork in our project history.

# 	* [Make a Rainbow]()

- We will continue developing our crazy experiment by changing **crazy.html** to the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Crazy Experiment</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>A Crazy Experiment</h1>
	<p>Look! A Rainbow!</p>

<ul>
    <li style="color: red">Red</li>
    <li style="color: orange">Orange</li>
    <li style="color: yellow">Yellow</li>
    <li style="color: green">Green</li>
    <li style="color: blue">Blue</li>
    <li style="color: indigo">Indigo</li>
    <li style="color: violet">Violet</li>
</ul>
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

# 	* [Stage and Commit the Rainbow]()

- Hopefully, you are relatively familiar with staging and committing snapshots by now:

```console
$ git add crazy.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   crazy.html
```

```console
$ git commit -m "add a rainbow to crazy.html"
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 01 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732641-03dc7200-9cd4-11ea-8d05-6d3d19922e60.png)

- Also notice that the **HEAD** (designated by the red circle) automatically moved forward to the new commit, which is intutively what we would expect when developing a project.
- The above diagram represents the complete state of our repository, but **git log** only displays the history of the current branch:

```console
$ git log
commit e1bc77119319d8b38ff46dbddd968f669cc37a4c

    Create index page for the message
```

- Note that the history **before** the fork is considered part of the new branch (marked with asterisks above).
- That is to say, the crazy history spans all the way back to the first commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 9 08 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82732774-f07dd680-9cd4-11ea-8454-50261fc15be0.png)

- The project as a whole now has a complex history, however, each individual branch still has a linear history (snapshots occur one after another).
- This means that we can interact with branches in the exact same way as we learned in the first two modules.

# 	* [Rename the Rainbow]()

- Let's add one more snapshot to the crazy branch.
- Rename **crazy.html to **rainbow.html, 

```console
mv crazy.html rainbow.html

- then use the following Git commands to update the repository

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    crazy.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	rainbow.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```console
$ git rm crazy.html
rm 'crazy.html'
```

- the git rm command tells Git to stop tacking crazy.html (and delete it if necesarry), and git add starts tracking rainbow.html.

```console
$ git add rainbow.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    crazy.html -> rainbow.html
```

- The renamed: crazy.html -> rainbow.html message in the final status output show us that Git is smart enough to figure out when we are renaming a file.

- Our snapshot is staged and ready to be commited:

```console
$ git commit -m "Rename craz.html to rainbow.html"
crazy 95a36a7] Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename crazy.html => rainbow.html (100%)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
95a36a7 (HEAD -> crazy) Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```
- After this addition, our complete repository history looks like the following

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 11 01 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82735083-cc29f600-9ce4-11ea-89b2-22cc74585e12.png)

- Remember that the crazy branch does not include any commits in master after the fork.
	
# 	* [Return to the Master Branch]()

- lets switch back to the master branch:

```console
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- After the checkout, crazy.html does not exist in the working directory, and the commits from the last few steps don't appear in the history. These two branches became completely independent development enviroment after they forked.
- You can think of them as separate project folders that you switch between with git checkout.
- They do, however, share their first four commits.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-23 at 11 37 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82735782-e0bcbd00-9ce9-11ea-9ccc-c6b53df0324c.png)

# 	* [Create a CSS Branch]()

- We are going to put our crazy experiment on the backburner for now and turn our attention to formatting the HTML pages with a cascading stylesheet (CSS).
- Again, if you are not comfortable with HTML and CSS, the content of the upcoming files is not nearly as important as the Git commands used to manage them.

- Let's create and check out a new branch called css.

```console
$ git branch css
```

- switch to css branch

```cosnsole
$ git checkout css
Switched to branch 'css'
```

- The new branch points to the currently checked out snapshot, which happens to coincide with the **master branch**

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 8 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82755691-e1f9f280-9d9a-11ea-9b4c-d44f0d352cae.png)

# 	* [Add a CSS Stylesheet]()

- Next, create a file called **style.css** with the following content.
- This CSS is used to apply formatting to the HTML in our other files.

```css
body {
  padding: 20px;
  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #111;
}

p, ul {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

ul {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

- Commit the stylesheet in the usual fashion

```console
$ git add style.css
$ git status
$ git commit -m "Add CSS stylesheet"
```

# 	* [Link the Stylesheet]()

- We still need to tell the HTML pages to use the formatting in style.css.
- Add the following text on a separate line after the **<title>** element in **index.html**, **blue.html** and **orange.html** (remember that rainbow.html only exist in the crazy branch).
- You should be able to see the CSS formatting by opening index.html in a web browser.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- Commit the changes

```console
$ git add index.html blue.html orange.html 
```

```console
$ git status
On branch css
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   blue.html
	modified:   index.html
	modified:   orange.html

```

```console
$ git commit -m "link HTML pages to stylesheet"
[css 1a27d0e] link HTML pages to stylesheet
 3 files changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
1a27d0e (HEAD -> css) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
3553479 (master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- This results in a repository history looks like:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 8 44 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82755691-e1f9f280-9d9a-11ea-9b4c-d44f0d352cae.png)

# 	* [Return to the Master Branch (again)]()

- The css branch let us create and test our formatting without threatening the stability of the **master branch**. But, new we need to merge these changes into the main project. Before we attempt the merge, we need to return to the master branch.

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

- Verify that style.css does not exist and that HTML pages are not linked to it.
- Our repository history remains unchanged, but the working directory now matches the snapshot pointer to by the **master branch**.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 9 27 38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82756619-d6a9c580-9da0-11ea-9445-a23d899e9189.png)

- take a look at the **git log --oneline** output as well.

```console
$ git log --oneline
3553479 (HEAD -> master) Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

- As expected, there is no mention of the CSS addition in the history of master, but we are about to change that.

# 	* [Merge the CSS Branch]()

- Use the git **merge** command to take the snapshots from the **css** branch and add them to the **master** branch.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 9 38 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82756851-508e7e80-9da2-11ea-8c28-66833b9b5a21.png)

- Instead of re-creating the commits in css and adding them to the history of master, Git reuses the existing snapshots and simply moves the tip of **master** to match the tip of **css**.
- This kind of merge is called a **fast-forward merge**, since Git is **"fast-forwarding"** through the new commits in the **css** branch.


- After the merge, both branches have the exact same history, which makes them redundant.
- Unless we wanted to keep developing on the css branch, we are free to get rid of it.

# 	* [Delete the CSS Branch]()

- We can safely delete a branch by passing the -d flag to git branch.

```console
$ git branch -d css
Deleted branch css (was 1a27d0e).
```

- Since **css** and **master** represent the same branch, our history looks the same, though the **css** branch has been removed.
- I have also put the master branch's commits in a straight line in the following visualization, making it easier to track during the upcoming modules.

```console
$ git branch
  crazy
* master
```

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 11 12 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82758981-8be37a00-9daf-11ea-93a4-35e65b332800.png)

- Deleting branches is a relatively **"safe"** operation in the sense that Git will warn you if you are deleting a unmerged branch.
- This is just another example of Git's commitment to never losing your work.

# 	* [Conclusion]()

Creating a new branch is really just a way to keep this high-level overview in mind during your every day development.

# 	* [Quick Reference]()

```console
$ git branch
$ git branch branchName
$ git checkout branchName
$ git merge branchName
$ git branch -d brachName
$ git rm fileName
```

# 5. [Branches II]()

Now that you have covered the mechanics behind Git Branches, we can discuss the practical impact that they have on the software development process.
Instead of introducing new commands, this module covers how the typical Git user applies this workfow to real projects, as well as some of the problems that arise in a branched enviroment.

To git, a branch is a branch, but it is often useful to assign special meaning to different branches. For example, we have been using **master** as the stable branch for our example project, and we have also used a temporary branch to add some CSS formatting.
Temporary branches like the latter are called **topic branches** becaue they exis to develop a certain topic branches later in this module.

Amid our exploration of Git branches, we will also discover that some merges cannot **"fast-forwarded"**
When the history of two branches diverges, a dedicated commit is required to combine the branches. This situation may also give rise to a merge conflict, which must be manually resolved before anything can be committed to the repository.


# 	* [Continue the Crazy Experiment]()

Let`s start by checking out the crazy branch.

```console
$ git branch
  crazy
* master
```

```console
$ git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
95a36a7 (HEAD -> crazy) Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

The crazy branch is a **longer-running** type of topic branch called a **feature branch**.
This is fitting, as it was created with the intention of developing a **specific feature**. It is also a term tht makes Git's contribution to the development workflow readly apparaent: **branches enable you to focus on developing one clearly defined feature at a time**

This brings us to my **rule-thumb for using git branches**:

1. Create a new branch for each mayor addition to your project.
2. Don't create a branch if you cannot give it a specific name.

Following these simple guidelines will have a dramatic impact on your programming efficiency.


# 	* [Merge the CSS Updates]()

Note that CSS formatting we merged into **master*Ç* is nowhere to be found.
This presents a bit of a problem if we want to experiment to reflect these updates.
Conveniently, Git let us merge changes into **any branch** (not just the master branch).
So, we can pull the updates in with the familiar **git merge** command.
Remember that merging only affects the checked-out branch.

```console
$ git merge maste
```

- editing

```vim
Merge branch 'master' into crazy
""
""
""
```

```console
$ git merge master
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 blue.html   |  1 +
 index.html  |  1 +
 orange.html |  1 +
 style.css   | 14 ++++++++++++++
 4 files changed, 17 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 style.css
```

As of Git 1.7.1.0, this will open your editor and prompt you for a message explaining why the commit was necessary.
You can use the default **Merge** branch **master** into crazy. When you save and close the file, you will notice an extra commit in your project history. Recall that our first merge didn't add any new commits; it is just **"fast-forwarded" the tip of the master branch. This was not the case for our new merge, which is shown below.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 11 50 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82759729-c7cd0e00-9db4-11ea-9b4b-8e97fc80512e.png)

Take a moment to examine why the current merge could not be **fast-forward one**. 
How Could Git have walked the crazy pointer over the tip of the master branch ?
It is not possible without backtracking, which kind of defeats the idea of **"fast-forwarding"**
We are left with a new way to combine brancges: **the 3-way merge**

A 3-way merge occurs when you try to merge two branches whose history has diverged. It creates an extra merge commit to function as a link between the two branches.
As a result, it has two parent commits. The above figure visualizes this with two arros originating from the tip of crazy. It is like saying **"this commit comes from both the crazy branch and from master"**. After the merge, the crazy branch has access to both its history an the master history.

The name comes from the internal method used to create the merge commit. Git looks at **three** commits (numbered in the above figure) to generate the final state of the merge.

This kind of branch interaction is a big part of what makes Git such a powerful development tool. We can not only create independent lines of development, but we can alsosharee information between them by tying together their stories with a 3-way merge.

# 	* [Style the Rainbow Page]()

Now that we have access to the CSS updates from master, we can continue developing our crazy experiment.
Link the CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html by adding the following HTML on the line after **title** element

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- Stage and commit the update, then check that it is reflected in the history

```console
$ git status
On branch crazy
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   rainbow.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```console
$ git commit -a -m "add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html"
[crazy 6a43f42] add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
6a43f42 (HEAD -> crazy) add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e (master) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

Notice that we skipped the staging step this time aroun.
Instead of using **git add**, we passed the -a flag to git commit.
This convenient parameter tells Git to automatically include all tracked files in the staged snapshot.
Combined with the -m flag, we can stage and commit snapshots with a single command.
However, be careful not to include unintended files when using the -a flag.

# 	* [Link to the Rainbow Page]()

We still need to add  navigation link to the home page.
Change the "Navigation sectio of index.html to the following.

```html
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
    <a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="rainbow.html">The Rainbow Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

As usual, stage and commit the snapshots.

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Link index.html to rainbow.html"
[crazy 4310454] Link index.html to rainbow.html
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
4310454 (HEAD -> crazy) Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e (master) link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Fork an Alternative Rainbow]()

Next, we are going to brainstorm an alternative to the current rainbow.html page.
This is a perfect time to create another topic branch:

```console
$ git branch crazy-alt
```

```console
$ git checkout crazy-alt
Switched to branch 'crazy-alt'
```

Remember, we can do whatever we want here without worrying about either crazy o master.
When **git branch** creates a branch, it uses the current **HEAD** as the starting point for the new branch.
This meeans that we begin with the same files as crazy (if we called **git branch** from **master**, we would have to re-create rainbow.html).
After creating th new branch, our repository's history looks like:


![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 8 26 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82816850-8181b880-9e61-11ea-8f1e-0019d14a9538.png)

# 	* [Change the Rainbow]()

Change the colorful list in rainbow.html from:

```html
  <li style="color: red">Red</li>
  <li style="color: orange">Orange</li>
  <li style="color: yellow">Yellow</li>
  <li style="color: green">Green</li>
  <li style="color: blue">Blue</li>
  <li style="color: indigo">Indigo</li>
  <li style="color: violet">Violet</li>”
```

to the following:

```html
<div style="background-color: red"></div>
<div style="background-color: orange"></div>
<div style="background-color: yellow"></div>
<div style="background-color: green"></div>
<div style="background-color: blue"></div>
<div style="background-color: indigo"></div>
<div style="background-color: violet"></div>
```

Then, add some CSS formatting to **head** on the line after the **meta** element

```html
	<style>
  div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 50px;
		 }
	 </style>
```

If you open rainbow.html in a browser, you should now see colorful blocks in place of the colorful text. Don't forget to commit the changes:

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Make a REAL rainbow"
[crazy-alt d247771] Make a REAL rainbow
 1 file changed, 13 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
```

The resulting project history is show below, with the first four commits ommitted for the sake of presentation.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 8 49 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82818699-b5aaa880-9e64-11ea-9eff-305ed0bca27d.png)


# 	* [Emergency Update]()

Our boss called in with some breaking news ! He needs us to update the site immediately, but what do we do with our rainbow.html developments? Well, the beauty of Git branches is that we can just leave them where they are and add the breaking news to master.

We will use what is called a **hotfix branch** to create and test the news updates. In contrast to our relatively long-running feature branch (crazy), hotfix branches are used to quickly patch a production release.

For example: you would use a hotfix branch to fix a time-sensitive bug in a public software project. This distinction is useful for demostrating when it is appropiate to create a new branch, but it is purely conceptual **- a branch is a branch according to Git**

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git branch news-hotfix
```

```console
$ git checkout news-hotfix
Switched to branch 'news-hotfix'
```

Change the "News" list in **index.html** to match the following.

```html
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="news-1.html">Blue Is The New Hue</a></li>
  </ul>
```

And, create a new HTML page called **news-1.html** with the following content.

```console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Blue Is The New Hue</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #079">Blue Is The New Hue</h1>
  <p>European designers have just announced that
  <span style="color: #079">Blue</span> will be this year's
  hot color.</p>
    
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

We can't use **git commit -a** to automatically stage **news-1.html** because it is an **untracked file** (as shown in **git status**).
So, let's use an explicit **git add**:

```console
$ git add index.html news-1.html 
```

```console
$ git status
On branch news-hotfix
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	new file:   news-1.html

```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add 1st news item"
[news-hotfix 049c9d9] Add 1st news item
 2 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 news-1.html
```

Text these additions in a browser to make sure that the links work, it is typo free, etc. Ifeverything looks good, we can "publish" the changes by merging them into the stable master branch. Isolating this in a separate branch is not really necessary for our trivial example, but in the real world, this would give you the opportunity to run build tests without touching your stable project.

# 	* [Publish the News Hotfix]()

Remember that to merge into the **master** branch, we first need to check it out.

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git merge news-hotfix
Updating 1a27d0e..049c9d9
Fast-forward
 index.html  |  2 +-
 news-1.html | 16 ++++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 news-1.html
```

Since **master** now contains the news update, we can delete the **hotfix** branch:

```console
$ git branch -d news-hotfix
Deleted branch news-hotfix (was 049c9d9).
```

```console
$ git branch
  crazy
  crazy-alt
* master
```

The following diagram reflects our repository's history before and after the merge. Can you figure out why was this a **fast-forward** merge instead of a **3-way merge**?

![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 9 40 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82822643-bb57bc80-9e6b-11ea-9d72-eb5c7f1d250c.png)

Also notice that we have another fork in our history (the commit before **master** branches in two directions), which means we should expect to see another merge commit in the near future.

# 	* [Complete the Crazy Experiment]()

Ok, lets finish up our crazy experiment with one more commit.

```console
$ git checkout crazy
Switched to branch 'crazy'
```

Note that the news article is nowhere to be found, as should be expected (this branch is completely isolated development environment).

We will finish up our crazy experiment by adding a news item for it on the home page. Change the news list in **index.html** to the following:

```html
<h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="rainbow.html">Our New Rainbow</a></li>
</ul>
```

Astute readers have probably observed that this directly conflicts with what we changed in the **news-hotfix** branch.
**We should not manually add in the other news item** because it has no relationship with the current branch. In addition, there would be no way to make sure the links works because **news-1.html** does not exist in this branch. This may seem trivial, but imagine the errors that could be introduced had **news-hotfix** made dozens of different changes.

We will simply stage and commit the snapshot as if there were no conflicts:

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Add news item for rainbow"
[crazy ebb4171] Add news item for rainbow
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Look at those experimental commits (marked with asterisks below)!

```console
$ git log --oneline
* ebb4171 (HEAD -> crazy) Add news item for rainbow
* 4310454 Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
* 95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
* e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
* 12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

# 	* [Publish the Crazy Experiment]()

We are finally ready to merge our **crazy** branch into **master**:

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git merge crazy
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

This is our first **merge conflict**. Conflicts occur when we try to merge branches that have edited the same content. Git does not know how to combine the two changes, so it stops to ask us what to do. We can see exactly what went wrong with the familiar **git status** command.

```console
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
	new file:   rainbow.html

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   index.html
```

We are looking at the staged snapshot of a merge commit. We never saw this with the first 3-way merge because we didn't have any conflicts to resolve. But now, Git stopped to let us modify files and resolve the conflict before committing the snapshot. The **"Unmerged paths"** section contains files that have conflict..

Open up index.html and find the section that looks like:

```console
<<<<<<< HEAD
	  <li><a href="news-1.html">Blue Is The New Hue</a></li>
=======
		<li><a href="rainbow.html">Our New Rainbow</a></li>
>>>>>>> crazy
```

$ git went ahead and modified the conflicted file to show us exactly which lines are afflicted. The format of the above text show us the difference between the two versions of the file. 

- The section **labeled** <<<<<<< HEAD show us the version in the current branch, while the part after the ======= shows the version in the **crazy** branch.

# 	* [Resolve the Merge Conflicts]()

We can change the affected lines to whatever we want in order to resolve the conflict. Edit the news section of **index.html** to keep changes from both versions:

```console
<h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="news-1.html">Blue Is The New Hue</a></li>
  <li><a href="rainbow.html">Our New Rainbow</a></li>
</ul>
```

The <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> markers are only used to show us the conflict and should be deleted. Next, we need to tell Git that we are done resolving the conflict:

```console
$ git add index.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
	modified:   index.html
	new file:   rainbow.html
```

That's right, all you have to do is **add index.html to the staged snapshot to mark it as resolved. Finally, complete the 3-way merge:

```console
$ git commit 
[master f79223d] Merge branch 'crazy'
```

We didn't ue the -m flag to specify a message beacuse Git already gives us a default message for merge commits. It also gives us a **"Conflict"** list, which can be particularly handy when trying to figure out where something went wrong in a project. Save and close the file to create the merge commit.

The final state of our project looks like the following.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 18 50 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82848331-af461c00-9eb8-11ea-881c-3d0868d16c01.png)

# 	* [Cleanup the feature Branches]()

Since our crazy experiment has been successfully merged, we can get rid of our feature branches.

```console
$ git branch -d crazy
Deleted branch crazy (was ebb4171).
```

```console
$ git branch -d crazy-alt
error: The branch 'crazy-alt' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D crazy-alt'.
```

As noted in the last module, the **git branch -d** command will not let you delete a branch that contains unmerged changes. But, we really do want to scrap the alternative experiment, so we will follow the error message's instructions for overriding this behavior:

```console
$ git branch -D crazy-alt
Deleted branch crazy-alt (was d247771).
```

Because we never merged **crazy-alt** into **master**, it is lost forever. However, the **crazy** branch is still accessible through its commits, which are now reachable via the **master** branch. That is to say, it is still part of the structure of the repository's history, even though we deleted our reference to it.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-25 at 19 38 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82849830-58901080-9ebf-11ea-9338-d8384871beac.png)

Fast-forward merges are not reflected in the project history. This is the tangible distinction between fast-forward merges and 3-way merges. The next module will discuss the appropiate usage of both and the potential complications of a non-linear history.

# 	* [Conclusion]()

This module demonstrate the three most common uses of Git Branches:

- To develop long-running features (crazy)
- To apply quick updates (news-hotfix)
- To record the evolution of a project (master)


# 	* [Quick Reference]()

```console
$ git commit -a -m "messageToCommit"
```

```console
$ git branch -D branchName
```

# 6. [Rebasing]()	

Let's start this module by taking an in-depth look at our history. The six commits asterisked below are part of the same train thought. 

We even developed them in their own feature branch. However, they show up interspersed with commits from other branches, along with a superfluous merge commit (b9f2b14).
In other words, our repository's history is kind of messy:

```console
$ git log --oneline
f79223d (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'crazy'
* ebb4171 Add news item for rainbow
049c9d9 Add 1st news item
* 4310454 Link index.html to rainbow.html
* 6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
* 95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
* e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
* 12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

Fortunately, Git includes a tool to help us clean up our commits: **git rebase**. 
**Rebasing lets us move branches around by changing the commit that they are based on.** 
Conceptually, this is what it allows us to do:

![Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 11 15 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82924636-3a1f2900-9f42-11ea-8f9a-fb7163b73a5e.png)

After rebasing, the feature branch has a new parent commit, which is the same commit pointed to by **master**. Instead of joining the branches with a merge commit, rebasing integrates the feature branch by building on top of **master**. The result is a perfectly linear history that reads more like a story than the hodgepodge of unrelated edits shown above.

To explore Git's rebasing capabilities, we will need to build up our example project so that we have something to work with. Then, we will go back and rewrite history using **git rebase**


# 	* [Create an About Section]()

We will begin by creating an about page for the website. Remember, we should be doing all of our work in isolated branches so that we don't cause any unintended changes to the stable version of the project.

```console
$ git branch about
```

```console
$ git checkout about
Switched to branch 'about'
```

The next few steps break this feature into several unnecessarily small commits so that we can see the effects of a rebase.

First, make a new directory in your repository called about. Then, create the empty file about/index.html. Stage and commit a snapshot.

```console
mkdir about
```

```console
$ git add about
```

```console
$ git status
```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add empty page in about section"
[about 27b0924] Add empty page in about section
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 about/index.html
```

# 	* [Add an About Page]()

Next, we will add some HTML to about/index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>About Us</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>We're a small, colorful website with just two employees:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="me.html">Me: The Developer</a></li>
    <li><a href="mary.html">Mary: The Graphic Designer</a></li>
  </ul>
    
  <p><a href="../index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Stage and commit the snapshot

```console
$ git status
On branch about
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about/index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Add contents to about page"
[about c94fb42] Add contents to about page
 1 file changed, 19 insertions(+)
```

After a few commits on this branch, our history looks like the following.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 11 41 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82927109-d1d24680-9f45-11ea-92c9-98439ff3652c.png)

# 	* [Another emergency update!]()

Our boss just gave us some more breaking news ! Again, we will use a hotfix branch to update the site without affecting our about page developments. Make sure to base the updates on **master**, not the **about** branch.

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git branch news-hotfix
```

```console
$ git checkout
```

```console
$ git checkout news-hotfix
Switched to branch 'news-hotfix'
```

```console
$ git branch
  about
  master
* news-hotfix
```

Commit a snapshot:

```console
$ git status
On branch news-hotfix
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Add 2nd news item to index page"
[news-hotfix 5142364] Add 2nd news item to index page
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Then, create a new page called news-2.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Red Rebellion</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #C03">A Red Rebellion</h1>    
  <p>Earlier today, several American design firms
  announced that they have completely rejected the use
  of blue in any commercial ventures. They have
  opted instead for <span style="color: #C03">Red</span>.</p>
    
  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Stage and commit another snapshot:

```console
$ git add news-2.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch news-hotfix
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   news-2.html
```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add article for 2nd news item"

 1 file changed, 17 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 news-2.html
```

# 	* [Publish News Hotfix]()

We are ready to merge the news update back into **master**

```console
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```console
$ git merge news-hotfix

Deleted branch news-hotfix (was 74afd90).
```

The **master** branch has not been altered since we created news-hotfix, so Git can perform a fast-forward merge. Our repository now looks like the following.

# 	* [Rebase the about Branch]()

This puts us in the exact position as we were in before our first 3-way merge. We want to pull changes from **master** into a feature branch, only this time we will do it with a rebase instead of a merge.

```console
$ git checkout about
Switched to branch 'about'
```

```console
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Add empty page in about section
Applying: Add contents to about page
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
ebfbefc (HEAD -> about) Add contents to about page
edff70e Add empty page in about section
74afd90 (master) Add article for 2nd news item
5142364 Add 2nd news item to index page
f79223d Merge branch 'crazy'
ebb4171 Add news item for rainbow
049c9d9 Add 1st news item
4310454 Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet
95a36a7 Rename crazy.html to rainbow.html
e1bc771 add a rainbow to crazy.html
3553479 Revert "Add a crazzy experiment"
12e24f0 Add a crazzy experiment
453c8a4 (tag: v1.0) Add navigation links
1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

Originally, the **about** branch was based on the Merge branch 'crazy-experiment' commit.
The rebase took the entire **about** branch and plopped it onto the tip of the **master** branch, which is visualized in the following diagram. Also notice that, like the **git merge** command, **git rebase** requires you to be on the branch that you want to move.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 16 56 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/82954216-e75d6580-9f71-11ea-8cd6-ad0e3c78d9d2.png)

After the rebase, **about** is a linear extension of the **master** branch, enabling us to do a **fast-forward** merge later on. **Rebasing** also allowed us to integrate the most up-to-date version of **master** without a merge commit.

# 	* [Add a Personal Bio](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

With our news hotfix out of the way, we can now continue work on our about section. Create the file about/me.html with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>About Me</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a big nerd.</p>

  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Computers</li>
    <li>Mathematics</li>
    <li>Typography</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="index.html">Return to about page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

```console
$ git add about/me.html
```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add HTML page for personal bio"
[about fbe3d49] Add HTML page for personal bio
 1 file changed, 21 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about/me.html
```

```console
$ git log --oneline
fbe3d49 Add HTML page for personal bio
ebfbefc Add contents to about page
edff70e Add empty page in about section
74afd90 Add article for 2nd news item
5142364 Add 2nd news item to index page
f79223d Merge branch 'crazy'
ebb4171 Add news item for rainbow
049c9d9 Add 1st news item
4310454 Link index.html to rainbow.html
6a43f42 add CSS stylesheet to rainbow.html
b9f2b14 Merge branch 'master' into crazy
1a27d0e link HTML pages to stylesheet
019e981 Add CSS stylesheet

1047951 t Add blue an orange html files
6a442fc Create index page for the message
```

Remember that thanks to the rebase, **about** rests on top of **master**. So, All of our **about** section commits are grouped together, which would not be the case had we merged instead of rebase. This also eliminates an unnecessary fork in our project history.


# 	* [Add Dummy Page for Mary](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

Once again, the next two snapshots are unneccessarily trivil. However, we will use an **interactive rebase** to combine them into a single commit later on. That's right, **git rebase** not only lets you move branches around, it enables you to manipulate individual commits as you do so.

Create a new empty file in the about section about/mary.html

```console
$ vim about/mary.html
```

```console
$ git status
On branch about
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   about/mary.html
```

```console
$ git commit -m "Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio"
[about 5f022e1] Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 about/mary.html
```

# 	* [Link to the About Section](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

Then, add a link to the about page in index.html so that its "Navigation" section looks like the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>A Colorful Website</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #07F">A Colorful Website</h1>
  <p>This is a website about color!</p>    
  
  <h2 style="color: #C00">News</h2>
  <ul>
	  <li><a href="news-1.html">Blue Is The New Hue</a></li>
		<li><a href="rainbow.html">Our New Rainbow</a></li>
    <li><a href="news-2.html">A Red Rebellion</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
    <a href="about/index.html">About Us</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #F90">
    <a href="orange.html">The Orange Page</a>
  </li>
  <li style="color: #00F">
<a href="blue.html">The Blue Page</a>
  </li>
	<li>
    <a href="rainbow.html">The Rainbow Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Don't forget to commit the change:

```console
$ git commit -a -m "Add link to about section in home page"
[about ce9d652] Add link to about section in home page
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

# 	* [Clean up the Commit History](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

Before we merge into the **master** branch, we should make sure we have a clean, meaningful history in our feature branch. By **rebasing interactively**, we can choose **how** each commit is transferred to the new base. Specify an interactive rebase by passing the -i flag to the rebase command:

```console
$ git rebase -i master
```

This should open up a text editor populated with all of the commits introduced in the **about** branch, listed from the oldest to newest. The listing defines exactly how Git will transfer the commits to the new base. Leaving it as is will do a normal **git rebase**, but if we move the lines around, we can change the order in which commits are applied.

In addition, we can replace the **pick** command before each line to **edit it** or **combine it** with other commits. All of the available commands are shown in the comment section of the rebase listing, but right now, we only need the **squash** command. This will condensate our unnecessarily small commits into a single, meaningful snapshot. Change your listing to match the following:

```console
pick edff70e Add empty page in about section
squash ebfbefc Add contents to about page
pick fbe3d49 Add HTML page for personal bio
squash 5f022e1 Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio
pick ce9d652 Add link to about section in home page
```

then get inside editor vi

```vim
pick edff70e Add empty page in about section
squash ebfbefc Add contents to about page
pick fbe3d49 Add HTML page for personal bio
squash 5f022e1 Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio
pick ce9d652 Add link to about section in home page

# Rebase 74afd90..ce9d652 onto 5f022e1 (5 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

After you edit, save and quit, it will appear the following 2 commit message:

```vim
# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Add empty page in about section

# This is the commit message #2:

Add contents to about page

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Tue May 26 11:32:08 2020 -0500
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 74afd90
# Last commands done (2 commands done):
#    pick edff70e Add empty page in about section
#    squash ebfbefc Add contents to about page
# Next commands to do (3 remaining commands):
#    pick fbe3d49 Add HTML page for personal bio
#    squash 5f022e1 Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio
# You are currently rebasing branch 'about' on '74afd90'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	new file:   about/index.html
#
```

after the two message:

```console
$ git rebase -i master
[detached HEAD 97a4a22] Add empty page in about section
 Date: Tue May 26 11:32:08 2020 -0500
 1 file changed, 19 insertions(+)

 2 files changed, 21 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about/mary.html
 create mode 100644 about/me.html
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/about.
```

The following list describes the rebasing process in-depth and tells you what you need to change along the way.

```vim
pick edff70e Add empty page in about section
squash ebfbefc Add contents to about page
pick fbe3d49 Add HTML page for personal bio
squash w5f022e1 Add empty HTML page for Mary's bio
pick ce9d652 Add link to about section in home page
```

1. Git moves the edff70e commit to the tip of **master**
2. Git combines the snapshots of ebfbefc and 5f022e1 
3. Git stops to ask you what commit message to use for the combined snapshot. It automatically includes the messages of both commits, but you can delete that and simplify it to just **Create the about page**. Save and exit the text editor to continue.
4. Git repeats this process for commits  ce9d652 and 5f022e1.  Use **Begin creating bio pages** for the message.
5. Git adds the final commit ce9d652 on top of the commits created in the previous steps.

You can see the result of all this activity with **git log --oneline**

```console
def4be5 (HEAD -> about) Add link to about section in home page
c5c692e Begin creating bio pages
f4bb8c3 Create the about page
74afd90 (master) Add article for 2nd news item
5142364 Add 2nd news item to index page
f79223d Merge branch 'crazy'
ebb4171 Add news item for rainbow

**Interactive rebasing** gives you complete control over your project history, but this can also be very dangerous. For example, if you were to delete a line from the rebase listing, the associated commit would not be transferred to the new base, and its content would be lost forever. In a future module, we will also see how rewriting history can get you in trouble with the public Git repositories.

# 	* [Stop to Amend a Commit](https://github.com/c4arl0s/RysGitTutorial#rysgittutorial)

The previous rebase only stopped us to edit the messages of each commit.
We can take this one step further and alter a **snapshot** during the rebase.
Start by running another interactive rebasing session. Note that we have still been using **master** as the new base because it selects the desired commits from the **about** branch.

```console
$ git rebase -i master
